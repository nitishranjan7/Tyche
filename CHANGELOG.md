# Changelog

A running log of commits to `index.html`, in order, for rollback reference. Each
entry lists what changed and the exact command to revert the working tree to
the state right before that commit shipped.

To roll back to just before a given commit (discarding it and everything after):

```
git reset --hard <commit>~1
git push --force origin main   # only if it was already pushed, and only after confirming with the user
```

To undo a single commit without touching the ones after it:

```
git revert <commit>
```

## Log (most recent first)

Each entry's "revert to" commit is the one immediately before it — i.e. the
state you'd land on with `git reset --hard <revert-to>`.

- `85502f9` — Wire Teams & Budgets into Expenses, Bills, and Cards — revert to `dd1487f`
  Tags each expense/bill/card with a `teamId`; team "spent" in Teams & Budgets is
  now computed from transactions + expenses + bills (sent-for-payment/paid) +
  card spend, instead of a hardcoded number.

  Bar chart (vendor/month toggle) + cosmetic date-range dropdown, new sidebar tab.

  Vendor table: name, owner, mock bank payment info, Active/Draft status.

  Overdue/due-this-month/due-next-month summary, 5-status filter chips, bill list.

  Submission-rate stat + expense list (date, card, merchant, amount, status).
- `1711f9d` — Switch to light color theme and fix minor UI issues — revert to `a695b71`
  Dark→light palette, contrast-safe brass/sage/rust text variants, dial hub dot fix.
